# Short Demo
A purposely fast-forwarded preview (for the attention-span challenged like me) of the clear, note, and update commands. 
- note: tells the program that you'd like to add a note to the athlete notes table. The program will prompt you for the day and message, depending on this command's order in the command chain.
- clear: clears the athlete notes, weight/nutrition tracker, and activity tracker.
- update: Retrieves the latest data from myFitnessPal and FitBit relative the most recent passed Sunday. Populates the weight/nutrition and activity trackers according to this data.
